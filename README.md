 A study on healthcare insurance charges reveals smoking status and BMI as key cost drivers, with age showing a positive correlation. The regional impact is lesser but present. Insights aim to help insurers refine pricing, healthcare professionals target interventions, and individuals make informed health decisions for better preventive care.
 
## Key Findings:
**Average Insurance Charge:** $13.27K
**Impact of Smoking:** Smokers pay significantly higher premiums ($32.05K) than non-smokers ($8.43K), making smoking the most influential cost driver.
**Regional Variations:** The Southeast has the highest average charges ($15K), while other regions like the Northwest and Southwest have lower costs ($12K).
**BMI Influence:** Overweight and obese individuals incur higher premiums due to increased health risks.
**Age Correlation:** Insurance costs generally rise with age, though some younger individuals also face high charges due to other risk factors.

## Analytical Approach:
**Individual Factor Analysis:** Examines the independent effect of each variable on insurance charges.
**Combined Effects Visualization:** Explores interactions between factors, such as smoking status and region.
**Distribution Analysis:** Investigate age groups, smoker prevalence, and risk categories for contextual insights.
**Multivariate Visualization:** Uses advanced techniques like 3D scatter plots to reveal complex relationships.
**Correlation Quantification:** Generates a correlation matrix to measure the strength of relationships between variables.

## Objective:
The study aims to provide actionable insights for insurers to refine risk assessment and pricing strategies, assist healthcare professionals in developing targeted interventions, and help individuals make informed decisions about health and preventive care.
