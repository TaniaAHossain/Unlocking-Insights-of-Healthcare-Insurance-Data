 A study on healthcare insurance charges reveals smoking status and BMI as key cost drivers, with age showing a positive correlation. The regional impact is lesser but present. Insights aim to help insurers refine pricing, healthcare professionals target interventions, and individuals make informed health decisions for better preventive care.
# Dashboard Analysis using Power BI 
## Overview 
This dashboard provides key insights into healthcare insurance charges based on factors such as age, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, and geographical region. The visualizations help identify major cost drivers and trends, enabling better risk assessment for insurance providers and informed health decisions for individuals.

The Healthcare Insurance Dashboard provides key insights into the factors influencing insurance charges, focusing on smoking status, BMI, age, and geographical region. The data analysis reveals that smoking status is the most significant cost driver, with smokers facing an average charge of $32.05K, compared to $8.43K for non-smokers. This substantial difference highlights the strong correlation between smoking and increased healthcare expenses due to associated health risks.

BMI (Body Mass Index) is also crucial in determining insurance costs. Individuals categorized as obese face the highest charges due to their elevated health risks, followed by overweight individuals, who also experience above-average costs. Those in the normal and underweight categories generally incur lower insurance expenses. The classification based on risk levels shows that individuals in the "Very High Risk" category (primarily obese individuals) have the highest healthcare charges.

The relationship between age and insurance charges exhibits a positive correlation, meaning that their insurance costs tend to rise as people age. The scatter plot analysis, supported by a trend line, confirms that while age is a factor, its impact is less pronounced compared to smoking and BMI.

Regional variations in insurance charges are observed but have a comparatively lower impact than smoking and BMI. The Southeast region has the highest average insurance cost ($15K), followed by the Northeast ($13K), while both the Northwest and Southwest regions show similar and lower average costs (~$12K). These findings suggest that location has some influence, possibly due to regional healthcare costs or lifestyle factors, but it is not the most critical determinant.

Additionally, the distribution of smokers by gender shows a nearly equal split, with male smokers comprising 47.39% and female smokers 52.61%. This indicates that smoking-related risks affect both genders similarly.

**Key Takeaways:**

*Smoking and BMI are the primary factors driving higher insurance charges.
*Age has a moderate impact, with costs increasing as individuals grow older.
*Regional differences exist but play a relatively smaller role in cost variations.
*The insights can help insurance providers refine pricing strategies, healthcare professionals develop targeted health interventions, and individuals make informed choices regarding preventive healthcare and financial planning.

These findings emphasize the importance of healthy lifestyle choices in reducing healthcare costs and provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the insurance and healthcare industries.
